1- We can use number, normal text, arthimetic symbol.

2 - we can control the mathematical order of operation (PEDMAS / BODMAS) in the function by setting a () in a right place - calc((2+3) * 4).

3- yes, we can.

4- We have to multiple the uniteless number by 1 with whatever a unit you want to set.

5- The "+" and "-" operators inside the function need spaces around them because the whitespace avoid concatenating of these arthimetic symbol which is invalid expression.

6- We can convert a value into a negative value by multiplying it -1.

7- I think we can use calc() to set color.
