# CSS exercise 40: Shadows

There are two types of shadows:

1. Box Shadows, or the shadows that run around or inside a box
1. Text Shadwos, or the ghostly shadow outlines of text.

Let's do some research on these shadowsâ€¦

1. `box-shadow` and `text-shadow` have very similar value syntax. Where do they differ?

=> Text-shadow doesn't take inset keyword and a thickness of shadow whereas box-shadow does.

1. If I wanted to create a hard-edge shadow, one that looks like a solid border, what combination of values would I need to use?

=> You need (x, y, blury, thickness, color)

1. Is it possible to create a shadow on a circular element? What about a polygon?

=> Yes it is possible by only using border raduis.

1. Is it possible to create multiple shadows on the same element?

=> Yes, it is popssible by specifying their own values.
