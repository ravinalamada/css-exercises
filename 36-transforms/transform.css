/*
1- The functions which we can use in transform are scale(), skew(), translte(), and rotate().

2- We have to set separate function because if we don't do that we won't get the outcome which we want to reach.
3- We need to separate the function when we set it in a specific selector.

4- We use transform-origin property.

5- It't preferable to use transform rather than position because it is more accurant.

6- The element will be positioned wrongly because the property which is not overwritten won't apply.

7- I think we use pespective property.

8- We can control what the transform uses in its calculations in terms of the box model by using transform-box.
