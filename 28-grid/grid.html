      Grid has 1 column by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between flexbox and grid is that you can work with both  dimensions at the same time with grid, whereas with flexbox you only able to set one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the reason why we use flexbox  rather than grid is that it is better to use when you want to arrange items in one dimension.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use grid rather than flexbox when we have multiple dimensions because grid can be used in two dimensions at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's like this grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 10rem)
    </p>
    <p>
      grid-template-columns: minmax( 50px, auto).
