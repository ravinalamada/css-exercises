        Overflow
      </h2>
      <p>
        If the witdh restraint is placed on a box, the content and text will be contained in that box neatly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default values of these properties:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>overflow:visible</li>
        <li>clip: auto</li>
        <li>clip-path: none</li>
        <li>text-overflow: ellipsis</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The reason why we use these properties is that we want the content or the text to fit in a box neatly. They are useful in dealing with the overflowing content for shake of the content fit inside a box.
      </p>
      <p>
        The browser let the content overlape to text below.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ellipsis (...) is key word which is used when you don't want to write the content fully.
      </p>
      <p>
        The text-overflow requires tow properties with its specific value which are white-space:nowrap, overflow:hidden and display:block or inline-block.
